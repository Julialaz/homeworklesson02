            <b>The Carpathian Mountains or Carpathians</b> are a mountain range system forming an arc roughly <em>1,500 km (932 mi)</em> long across Central Europe, into Eastern, and in Southeastern Europe, making them the second-longest mountain range in Europe (after the Scandinavian Mountains, <em>1,700 km (1,056 mi))</em>.
            They provide the habitat for the <strong>largest European populations</strong> of <big>brown bears, wolves, chamois and lynxes</big>, with the highest concentration in Romania,[2][3][4] <small>as well as over one third of all European plant species</small>.[5] The Carpathians and their foothills also have many thermal and mineral waters, with Romania having one-third of the European total.[6][7] Romania is likewise home to the second largest surface of virgin forests in Europe after Russia, totaling 250,000 hectares (65%), most of them in the Carpathians,[8] with the Southern Carpathians constituting Europeâ€™s largest unfragmented forested area.[9]
