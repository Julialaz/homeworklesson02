            <b>The Carpathian Mountains or Carpathians</b> are a mountain range system forming an arc roughly <em>1,500 km (932 mi)</em> long across Central Europe, into Eastern, and in Southeastern Europe, making them <strong><em>the second-longest mountain range in Europe</em></strong> (after the Scandinavian Mountains, <em>1,700 km (1,056 mi))</em>.
            They provide the habitat for the <strong>largest European populations</strong> of brown bears, wolves, chamois and lynxes, with the highest concentration in Romania,[2][3][4] <small>as well as over one third of all European plant species</small>.[5] <b>The Carpathians</b> and their foothills also have many thermal and mineral waters, with Romania having one-third of the European total.[6][7] Romania is likewise home to the second largest surface of virgin forests in Europe after Russia, totaling 250,000 hectares (65%), most of them in the Carpathians,[8] with the Southern Carpathians constituting Europe’s largest unfragmented forested area.[9]
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>The Carpathians</i> consist of a chain of mountain ranges that stretch in an arc from the <mark>Czech Republic</mark> (3%) in the northwest through <mark>Slovakia</mark> (17%), <mark>Poland</mark>(10%), <mark>Hungary</mark> (4%) and <mark>Ukraine</mark> (11%) to <mark>Romania</mark>(53%) in the east and on to the Iron Gates of the Danube River between <mark>Romania</mark> and <mark>Serbia</mark> (2%) in the south. The highest range within the Carpathians is the Tatras, on the border of Slovakia and Poland, where the highest peaks exceed <em>2,600 m (8,530 ft)</em>. The second-highest range is the Southern Carpathians in Romania, where the highest peaks exceed <em>2,500 m (8,202 ft)</em>.
        </p>
        <p>The divisions of the Carpathians are usually in three major sections: 
            <ul>
                <li>Western Carpathians — Czech Republic, Poland, and Slovakia.</li>
                <li>Eastern Carpathians — southeastern Poland, eastern Slovakia,<br> Ukraine, Romania.</li>
                <li>Southern Carpathians — Romania, Serbia.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
